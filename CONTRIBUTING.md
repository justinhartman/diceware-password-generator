## How to Contribute to this Project

### Did you find a Bug?

  * **Ensure your bug has not already been reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](issues).
  * If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](new-issue). 
  * Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behaviour that is not occurring.

### Did you write a Patch?

Whether it is fixing a bug or developing a new feature you want included in this project; follow these simple guidelines.

  * Open a new GitHub Pull Request with your code patch.
    1. Fork this project
    1. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
    1. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
    1. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
    1. Submit a Pull Request :tada:

  * Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem, or your new feature, as well as your proposed solution or implementation. Include the relevant [issue number](issues), if applicable.

### Do you want to add a new feature or, change an existing one?

  * Suggest your change as a [new issue](new-issue) using the label `enhancement` **_before_** you start writing code. I would hate for you to waste time as your new feature/change may not align with the project roadmap. Assume nothing, always check it out first.

Thank you for contributing to this project! Your help is valued far more than you may realise. :heart:
