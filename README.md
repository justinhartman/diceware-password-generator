# Diceware Password Generator
The [Diceware Password Generator][dpg] is open-source software written in Python that uses one of five a world lists and _dice_ to output an easy to remember, yet highly secure password based on a sequence of words like `boots-imbecile-nextdoor-espresso-cosmetics-remote`.

Diceware is a method for picking passphrases that uses dice to select words at random from a special list called the Diceware Word List. Each word in the list is preceded by a five digit number. All the digits are between one and six, allowing you to use the outcomes of five dice rolls to select a word from the list.

Using Dicewear as a methodology ensures that not only is a password like `mumbo-giver-alarm-lived-gig-wages-exit` easy to memorise, it is over **100 times**<sup>[[1]](#footnote)</sup> more secure than traditional passwords such as this `%u}+6:~TY/(8uR[/vB`.

The Diceware Password Generator was made to simplify the creation of these easy, yet very difficult to hack passwords on the fly.
